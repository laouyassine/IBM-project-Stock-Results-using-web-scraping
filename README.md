# IBM-project-Stock-Results-using-web-scraping
This project is an IBM project which my role is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings 
from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. 
After collecting this data I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends.
The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
